 * Verifies if a given user (identified by their wallet address) has joined
 * a specific Discord server.
 *
 * In a real-world scenario, this would involve:
 * 1. A system where users link their Discord account to their wallet address.
 * 2. Using the Discord API to check if the linked user is a member of the target server.
 *
 * For now, this function will simulate a successful verification.
 *
 * @param userAddress - The wallet address of the participant.
 * @param discordServerId - The ID of the Discord server to check.
 * @returns A promise that resolves to true if the user is in the server, false otherwise.
